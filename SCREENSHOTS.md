## Report Integration

### Suggested Figure Captions Format:

```
Figure X: [Title]
[Description of what is shown]
[Key observations or insights]
[Technical details if relevant]
```

### Example:
```
Figure 3: Forecast Overlay on Historical Candlestick Chart

The chart displays 100 days of historical AAPL stock prices as candlesticks,
with a 7-day forecast overlaid as a purple dashed line. The forecast was
generated using the LSTM model with a sequence length of 60 days. The smooth
continuation of the trend demonstrates the model's ability to learn temporal
patterns. Performance metrics: RMSE=2.34, MAE=1.87, MAPE=1.2%.
```
